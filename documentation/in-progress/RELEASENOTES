<h1 id="apache-yetus--0120-snapshot-release-notes">Apache Yetus  0.12.0-SNAPSHOT Release Notes</h1>

<p>These release notes cover new developer and user-facing incompatibilities, important issues, features, and major improvements.</p>

<!-- markdown -->

<p>When configured to use emoji for plugin votes when posting feedback to GitHub, Yetus now ensures that those emojis have different shapes to designate meaning instead of just color differences.</p>

<p>This change should allow users who have color-blindness to differentiate between meanings while scanning the result column.</p>

<p>Adds a function {{add_docker_build_arg}} taking a key or key and value to export to the Docker build via {{–build-arg}}.</p>

          <td><strong>test-patch.sh does not do gradle</strong></td>
        </tr>

    </table>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Gradle support has been modified to support modern gradle layouts.  As such, this is an incompatible change for gradle.  Bootstrapping gradle is no longer supported; gradlew is expected to be there.  Patches that wish to upgrade gradle are now expected to just be a patch against the gradle components in the repo.</p>

<p>* checkstyle should now work<br />
* $HOME/.gradle is no longer imported into docker containers to prevent cache corruption<br />
* a new &lt;plugin&gt;_postcleanup has been added. In the case of gradle, this now shuts down the gradle daemon<br />
* two new core routines have been added (escape_html/unescape_html) to cover some basic HTML entity resolution. These are not exhaustive but cover the most common ones seen.  <br />
* GRADLE_ARGS is now GRADLEW_ARGS to match the functionality change.</p>

<p>This patch alters `report_jvm_version` to extract JVM vendor and version information from Java system properties. It now returns a string that is the concatenation of verdor and runtime versions.</p>

<p>&lt;!–markdown –&gt;<br />
Many of the versions of tools in the bundled Dockerfile have been upgraded.  Note that the configuration for those binaries may or may not be backward compatible.</p>

<p>Also, the default the 'pylint' binary in the bundled Dockerfile has been switched to pylint3 to reflect that cpython version 2 is no longer supported upstream.  Setting `–pylint=pylint2` on the test-patch command line will use the older version of pylint, similar to previous releases.</p>
